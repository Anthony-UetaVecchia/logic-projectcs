## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects aimed at showing my programming logic skills based on Alura course.

## Projects

### Project 1: Secret Number Game

**Description:** This project covers fundamental algorithms such as conditionals and simple functions. (The game-js-2 doesn't have much changes compared to the game-js-1, but since they're different modules, I sepparated them)

**Files:**
- `app.js`: A script that contains all the game, that will make it playable.
- `index.html`: the script that will display it, so the user can play the game.

### Project 2: Consolidation - not iniciated

**Description:**

**Files:**
- `exemple.ex`: .
